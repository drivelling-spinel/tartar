# Tartar

Tartar is a Doom source port for DOS, author aiming for it to be useful
to players running pure (as in non-emulated) DOS or Windows 9X on modern 
machines for retro gaming. 

## Tartar highlights

- Has better audio compatibility through updated Allegro library 
  from [MBF 2.0.4 Maintenance Release](doc/COPYRGHT/MBFUP204.TXT)
  and plays 16 bit sound effectsÂ (useful if you have SB16 or later)
- Supports additional screen resolutions 640x480 and 1280x1024
  with and without upscaling from smaller core rendering resolution
  and optional aspect ratio correction for non-CRT displays
- Includes numerous quality of life improvements including 
  auto-loading of WAD, DEH and BEX files to include
  skins, fixes and WAD compatibility packs for specific PWADs
- Offers extended game view size for higher resolutions, 
  new optional "grille" translucency for sprites and textures and 
  new optional "simplified" and more accessible level shading mode  
- Contains many bugfixes and PWAD compatibility improvements
- Implements the compulsory blood spat recoloring for "hissies", 
  "bruisers", flemoids, ubermutants and roaches

## What to play with Tartar

- Original Caverns of Darkness TC for DOS
- Curios from what remains of the cancelled Eternity TC
- Vanilla Doom 2, TNT Evilution and Plutonia Experiment   
  (with animated intermission screens a-la Doom 1 courtesy of 
  Doomworld user \@oliacym)
- No Rest for the Living (aka NERVE.WAD), Sigil and Sigil II   
  with proper map names, music tracks assignment, levels and secrets   
  progression and (for NERVE) intermission backdrops courtesy of \@oliacym 
  with helper WAD included in the distribution
- Chex Quest without Doom IWAD - and it will end after level 5!   
  (also green slime splashes can be activated by switching on particles)
- Wolfendoom collection by Laz Rojas (MAC versions strongly preferred!)
  with helper WAD included in the distribution
- Strain TC for DOS - via a compatibility option to change [MBF collisions code]
  (https://www.doomworld.com/forum/post/2507168)
- Sunlust and maps using _uncompressed_ extended nodes table format
- Eviternity and maps using sprites and textures that are
  more than 255 pixels tall
- Ancient Aliens and maps with non 9px high fonts, elaborate MUS format music tracks
  and non power-of-2 wide textures 
- Avactor and maps with DeepSea extended node format
- Hydrosphere and maps with higher resolution sky textures,
  in this case also with proper progression and ending
  with helper WAD included in the distribution
- The Long Trek Back Home with intermission backdrops by \@oliacym 
  with helper WAD included in the distribution
- 2022 A Doom Odyssey with non-episodic linear progression through all maps,
  proper secrets progression and intermission screens 
  with helper WAD included in the distribution
- ??? and maps with non-Unix line endings in DeHackEd patches, 
  or other DeHackEd patches sheninegans like references to non-existant code pointers
  (e.g. Rush)
- HACX 1.1 without Doom II IWAD  
  (but make sure Tartar is given a PLAYPAL, e.g. by putting one of InstaDoom
  filter WAD-s into FILTERS directory AND that text mode startup is on!)
- Also - only if you are desperate enough - The People's Doom as IWAD
- ... and last but not least Doom 1.1 with tiled status bar extravaganza and demo playback

## Also...
... for some traits "less common among source ports":
- Best effort at loading GENMIDI lump for more accurate music playback   
  with FM sound cards
- Arcade play mode where player is resurrected on the spot without
  level restarting 
- Next/prev music track bindable hotkeys and music tracks randomizer
- Screenshots from virtually anywhere in the game with bindable hotkey
- Cycle through InstaDoom filters (or any other PLAYPAL/COLORMAP providing
WAD-s for that matter) without restarting the level
- Voltron assembly features:
  -- drop in SELFIE.WAD and SELFIE.DEH to make sefies in any PWAD
     and still shoot plasma rifle happily 
  -- drop in JUMPWAD.WAD to switch to "pogo stick" mode in any PWAD
     and jump around by pressing fire
     (by the way, you can also load Jumpwad as a PWAD with Tartar)
- Send regards to the loved ones with a bindable hotkey, 
  (e.g. while recording a video)

## What Tartar CANNOT do
While these traits may be more common among source ports these days,
this is not what Tartar supports:
- Cannot display PNG sprites and textures
- Cannot load _compressed_ extended format node tables or Hexen format maps
- Cannot play OGG, MP3 or FLAC sounds or music
- Cannot process UMAPINFO or singe lump stand alone EMAPINFO lumps
- Cannot cope with MBF21 and DEHEXTRA features and code pointers in DeHackEd patches
- Cannot run Heretic, Hexen or Strife 
- Cannot apply EDF or DECORATE extensions from the mods to the game
- Is not guaranteed to play demos in _more recent_ "Boom" or "MBF" formats

Tartar's WAD autoloading makes it easy to add fix packs
to the installation. Suggested WAD-s to try out include:
  - [Doom Sound Bulb](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/110822) by \@SeanTheBermanator
  - [Hi Res Doom Sound Effects Pack](https://www.perkristian.net/game_doom-sfx.shtml) by \@perkristian

3. Or if Tartar will be used with multiple IWADs drop the WAD into
   a subdirectory of FIXES that has name matching the name of the IWAD
   the fix pack is to be loaded with. For example:
      
  C:\GAMES\TARTAR\   
  C:\GAMES\TARTAR\TARTAR.EXE   
  ...   
  C:\GAMES\TARTAR\FIXES\

   and [Aftermath](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/themes/wolf3d/aftermth) and its   
   [prerequisites](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/themes/wolf3d/wolfdoom).   
   For playing classic Artctic Wolf the following updates may also be of interest:   
   [arc_fix.zip](https://doomworld.com/3ddownloads/wolfendoom/arc_fix.zip)   
   [Lrbjskin.zip](https://doomworld.com/3ddownloads/wolfendoom/Lrbjskin.zip)

   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\   
   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\TARTAR.EXE   
   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\DOOM.WAD2   
   ...   
   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\SHIMS\   
   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\SHIMS\SOD.WAD

   TARTAR -FILE CONFRONT NOCT.DEH   
   TARTAR -FILE ESCAPE ORIGINAL.DEH   
   TARTAR -FILE 2ND_ENC 2ND_ENC.DEH   
   TARTAR -FILE AFTERMTH   

   _Note_ that Tartar will pull the other required WAD-s from the   
   directory where the specified PWAD-s sit, so there's no need to   
   type all of them, as long as they have been copied there.

   For _original_ Operation Arctic Wolf:
   TARTAR -FILE GFX1 ARCTIC1.DEH

   For Operation Arctic Wolf Special Edition:
   TARTAR -FILE ARCTGFX1 ARCTIC1.DEH

   _Note_ that for Arctic Wolf there is no need to quit and change the way   
   the game is launched midway though. Tartar will automatically reload   
   the required PWAD/DEH combination based on the level being played.

6. _Optionally_ add WOLFMIDI.WAD to play with original Wolfenstein music.   
   The music tracks (courtesy of [VGMPF](https://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Wolfenstein_3D_(DOS))   
   cand be found in GOODIES\WOLFMIDI directory of the distribution.

   TARTAR -FILE HALTEN WOLFMIDI
   
7. _Optionally_ Tartar will automatically load B J Blazkowicz skin   
   with Wolfendoom if it is placed in SKINS directory where TARTAR is found.   
   Obtain it [here](https://doomworld.com/3ddownloads/wolfendoom/Lrbjskin.zip).   
   For example:
   
   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\   
   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\TARTAR.EXE   
   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\DOOM.WAD2   
   ...   
   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\SHIMS\   
   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\SHIMS\2ND_ENC.WAD   
   ...
   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\SKINS\   
   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\SKINS\BJ.WAD   
   
   TARTAR -FILE 2ND_ENC 2ND_ENC.DEH

Tartar offers first class support for some of the excellent mods by Doom community.   
Here's how to enable Doom 2 intermission screen maps created by \@olyacim.

1. Install Tartar.

2. Drop INTMAPD2.WAD found in GOODIES\OLIACYM directory of the distribution   
   and place itnto the same same directory as TARTAR.EXE. For example:

   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\

   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\DOOM2.WAD   
   C:\GAMES\TARTAR\INTMAPD2.WAD

   in the same directory as TARTAR.EXE.

4. Run TARTAR.EXE. When running without PWAD-s no additional arguments   
   are required. _When running with PWADS, enable the intermission_   
   _maps by adding -wimaps command line argument._
