## On the name of the port

I've been asked why Tartar refers to itself as Eternity Engine when
being run. As Tartar's author I personally have no issue with this small
identity crisis and would not hurry resolving it. Even though Tartar comes
from 2021 it is in a way a thing of the past, and in author's opinion,
retaining such small bits and pieces is no less than essential 
to arrive with a consistent and integral "retro" product.

Of course, if this indeed confuses players, author will make the necessary changes,
(after all they are not hard to make).

The name itself... could it be that Tartar is from Greek Tartarus 
(Τάρταρος) that is the deepest abyss in Ancient Greek mythology where,
no doubt, demons and horrible beasts of chaos roam. A suitable place
for Doom protagonist to visit...  

Well, in fact not. Instead Tartar continues a glorious tradition of giving Doom 
source ports gastronomic names. It is a name of the white sause, 
traditionally served with fried fish (and chips). Indeed, cod is even more delicious 
when served with tartar.
