**** FEATURES ****

Eternity is the newest source port to inherit the banner of BOOM. Descended
from MBF, it attempts to carry on the effort to put editability, reliability,
and compatibility first. From SMMU it also gains the momentum to give the player
new options rather than to dictate DOOM purity.

Eternity includes FULL BOOM compatibility, as well as most features added in
MBF and SMMU (exceptions include MBF's beta emulation support which is not
included, and SMMU v3.30's thing script area). In addition, Eternity adds many
more, including these:

* TerrainTypes
  
  Effects that can be triggered by an object hitting the floor. These are
  editable by the user and can be associated with any flat. The TerrainEd
  utility can be used to generate a TERTYPES lump which can be inserted into
  your wad.
  
* New Thing Flags

  Multiple new effects can be achieved by placing flags in the Bits2 field of
  things in a DeHackEd or BEX patch. These flags are covered in ETCDEH.TXT.
  
* Helper Specification

  By using a [HELPER] block in a DeHackEd or BEX file you can easily specify
  the type of helper creature the player has when using the -dogs command-line
  parameter.
    
* Extensions to FraggleScript

  Eternity includes a large and growing number of features that extend the
  FraggleScript scripting language. Up to 256 scripts can now be defined for
  each level, things have access to scripts via the StartScript pointer, numerous
  new functions for all types of purposes exist, including the new FraggleScript
  heads-up pic display inspired by SoM's DOOM Legacy implementation.
  
* Custom Sound Substitution Per Level
  
  Through the SMMU map header information, Eternity can specify custom sounds
  for environmental actions independently for each level. This allows levels of
  multiple themes to co-exist in the same TC or megawad without need for large
  clumsy lumps of data.
  
* Double Skies and Lightning

  Eternity has special features for skies including double skies which allow
  one sky to be drawn transparently on top of another and allowing both to scroll
  without use of scrolling linedefs, and lightning, which when enabled, causes
  flashes of light and appropriate sounds in all sky sectors on a level.
  
* Full Keybinding System
  
  Based on but more powerful than SMMU v3.30's keybinding system, Eternity
  can rebind most keys in the game (those which are not dynamically bindable can 
  still be set through the config file). KEYS.CSC console script contains default 
  bindings and can be edited by the user if desired.
  
* Dialog
  
  Characters can interact with the player by starting compiled dialog scripts.
  
* Bug Fixes

  This port has addressed most known issues in SMMU v3.21, as well as many
  bugs from MBF and even original DOOM. This includes most of the fixes from
  the PRBoom port, which enable more robust demo compatibility and better memory 
  usage.

I'm certain to have left out some cool things, so check all the editing docs
for more information!

**** Features New to Version 3.29 Gamma ****

These include some of the major features added in the latest version:

* Windows Support
 
  Eternity is now available for both DOS and Windows!
  
* Particle Event System, Other Particle Enhancements

  Particle events can now be attached to frames. Editing support for
  DeHackEd is not complete yet, but will be available in the future.
  Bullet puffs are now lighter, both puffs and blood can use either
  sprites or particles, or both, bullet puff particles now respond to 
  TerrainTypes when they are enabled, changing color to reflect the type 
  of surface being shot, and finally, particle fountains in multiple
  colors are available, with doomednums in the range of 9027 - 9033
  (this matches zdoom exactly).
  
* Quicksave and Quickload

  Quicksave and Quickload features have been restored to their previous
  functionality. Can be bound on the Environment keys menu.

**** COMING SOON ****

These are features planned to debut in future versions of the Eternity Engine:

* Priority *
