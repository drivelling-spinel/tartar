   v3.29 Development Beta 5

------------------------------

This is a special development beta release of the Eternity Engine
intended to demonstrate new features added up until now, but
not intended to be a complete, stable product.

package, see http://doomworld.com/eternity/ for more information.

=============================
New Features in This Version:
=============================

* Particle system
  
  Adapted from zdoom, the particle system allows low-bandwidth,
  high-impact effects for blood, smoke, fountains, environmental
  ambience, etc.  All effects are optional and can be independently
  enabled or disabled via the menus and console.  
  
  Thanks due to Randy Heit for much of the code.

* MapInfo Extensions

  Added nextsecret field to allow customizable secret exit
  destinations for any level. Also added an exitsecret function
  to FraggleScript to help support this new feature.

* Translucent text

  FraggleScript strings can now specify translucency using the
  \z escape.

* Fully functional dialogue system

  startdialogue function for FraggleScript can run compiled dialogue
  scripts which can display text, character names and pictures,
  and call back into FraggleScript to play sounds, move the game
  camera, and change thing angles.  Cinematic pause can stop
  player and monster movement during dialogues and other events.

===========================
Bugs Fixed in This Version:
===========================

* Mouse double-clicking actions should now work, and the buttons
  which can be double-clicked to generate a use action can be
  set in the configuration file, independent of any action bound
  to those mouse buttons by the keybinding system.

* Joystick buttons no longer generate double-click events.

* Setting player name via menu should not crash the game.

* More robust handling of text in heads-up and finale systems with
  respect to tabs and characters with no font glyph.

* Walkcam should be able to move again.

* Removed monster falling damage.

* Restored default global translucency %age to 66%

* Player bobbing properly recorded as a demo- and net-sync critical
  variable. Bobbing console command is now a netcmd.

* Several printf calls in video mode removed.

* Sprites properly clipped w.r.t. deep water when viewed from a 
  camera.
