(*)     - although shim is loaded earlier than any other WAD (even IWAD), 
          it's lumps cannot be overridded by any other WAD loaded afterwards
(**)    - list of filenames fo PWAD-s that are checked for accompanying WAD and DEH files follows
          - BTSX_E?*.WAD
          - KDIKDI_*.WAD
          - 1ST_ENC.WAD 
          - AFTERMTH.WAD
          - SOD.WAD
          - CONFRONT.WAD
          - TRAIL.WAD
          - SECRET.WAD
          - FUHRER.WAD
          - FAUST.WAD
          - ESCAPE.WAD
          - ARCTIC.WAD 
          for Arctic Wolf ARCTGFX1.WAD, ARCTGFX2.WAD, GFX1.WAD or GFX2.WAD can also be given
(***)   - "extras" start here
          these are loaded only after all preceding assets have been loaded and processed
          extras are always optional and loading can be avoided altogether with -noload
          also extras do not reflect in the list of loaded WAD-s, e.g. with LISTWADS CCMD
(****)  - only some lumps are loaded from these PWAD-s and DEH patches are very specially handled 
(*****) - intermission PWAD-s are only loaded when no other PWAD-s are specified 
          but with -wimaps loading of intermission PWAD-s can be forced 
          PWAD-s' filenames are:
          - INTMAPD2.WAD for DOOM2.WAD
          - INTMAPEV.WAD for TNT.WAD
          - INTMAPPL.WAD for PLUTONIA.WAD
