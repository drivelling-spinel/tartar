**** DESCRIPTION *********************************************************

Eternity is the newest source port to inherit the banner of BOOM. 
Descended from MBF, it attempts to carry on the effort to put editability, 
reliability, and compatibility first. From SMMU it also gains the momentum
to give the player new options rather than to dictate DOOM purity.

Eternity includes FULL BOOM compatibility, as well as most features added 
in MBF and SMMU. In addition, Eternity adds many more. Check out the ex-
tensive documentation package for full information.


**** Features New to Version 3.31 Public Beta 7 **************************

These include some of the major features added in the latest version:

* High Resolution Support

  Eternity now supports several new video modes, including true 320x240 
  and 640x480, as well as 800x600 and 1024x768.

* Portal Improvements

  A few problems were repaired in the portal system, and line type 296 has
  been adjusted to use a new anchor line type 299, so that it can be 
  attached to the same sector as a 295 line. See the Editing Reference for
  full information.

* New Codepointer

  HealthJump allows "frame scripting" of actions depending on an object's 
  health. See the Codepointer Reference for more information.
    
**** COMING SOON *********************************************************

These are features planned to debut in future versions of the Eternity 
Engine:

** ULTRA-HIGH PRIORITY **

* Small Scripting Engine (Almost ready for use!)
