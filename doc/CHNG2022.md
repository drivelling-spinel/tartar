# Comprehensive list of changes in 2022 Spring Refresh

## Menu

- Additional key bindings submenu for palette and screenshot-related commands

- Select WAD menu entry has been removed

## Video

- TRANMAP is not generated nor used at all in case when "checkered" transparency is enabled with r_fauxtrans CVAR

- TRANMAP is no longer cached between runs and is instead generated using the palette of currently loaded WADs; it is still saved to disk e.g for the purpose of being used as a lump

- Palettes from currently loaded WADs can be cycled through on the fly with new bindable pal_next, pal_prev console commands. PLAYPAL, COLORMAP (and TRANMAP in case translucency is enabled) lumps are cycled in sync while cycling through palettes

## System

- Keypress processing has been reorganized to allow bindable console commands in most of the game screens, including title screen

- FreeDOOM, FreeDM, TPD and HacX WAD names have been added to the list of IWAD filenames Tartar searches for during startup

- For Doom 2 WADs (i.e. the ones with MAPXY level marker lump names) Tartar attempts to detect the final level of the loaded WADs to finish the game and show cast roll after this final map has been completed by the player

## WADS compatibility

- Doom 2 PWADs with more than 32 maps are supported

- WADs with SS_/FF_START but no corresponding S_/F_START lumps are supported

- Maps with empty REJECT lumps no longer crash the game

- Maps with more that 32k sides or lines no longer crash the game (e.g. Eviternity Dehydration or Imperator can be loaded)

- In case of maps that Tartar would not be able to handle it drops to console showing an error message rather than crashing

- Tartar now has more relaxed checks for texture definition and would log the errors it detects rather than quit immediately; related error messages are now also more friendly

- New command line argument -nodemos has been added for the player to suppress demo if it's found to be choppy or jittery for particular WADs

- Commander Keen suffering sounds have been restored

- Eternity TC actors would now be spawned only while in Eternity mode OR with Caverns of Darkness loaded; CoD actors would only be spawned when CoD is loaded with certain actors replacing Eternity TC ones in case the same Doomednum is used for them

## Gameplay changes and bugfixes

- Automap shows correct level time, not an arbitrary value like before

- BEX-style string definitions without a space before equals sign are correctly processed

- Mnemonically-specified flags (and flags2) for Things (bits and bits2 attributes to be exact) in DEH patches will now be applied

- WADs found in FILTERS directory will be loaded automatically upon startup with all but PLAYPAL, COLORMAP and TRANMAP stripped from them. These have special treatment and will not override the lumps from WADs players may have loaded explicitly, but will be available for on the fly palette cycling with pal_next. Use pal_list console command to print the list of loaded palette WADs (both player-specified and extras). Players can simply unpack InstaDoom zip into the directory with TARTAR.EXE to see how this feature works

- "Intelligent" blood recoloring has been adjusted:
-- Chex player bleeds yellow, not green
-- Player with Godmode cheat bleeds yellow, not red
-- Roaches bleed green, not red

## New CVARS, commands and configuration parameters

- pal_curr CVAR
- pal_next, pal_list, pal_prev console commands
- screenshot console command
- detect_finallevel configuration parameter
